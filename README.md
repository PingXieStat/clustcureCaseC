# clustcureCaseC

Supplement to 'Case-cohort studies for clustered failure time data with a cure fraction]{Case-cohort studies for clustered failure time data with a cure fraction'.

R code and data for analysis in Ping Xie, Bo Han, Xiaoguang Wang. 

This function fits a promotion time cure model for clustered failure time data under Case-cohort study, where the unknown baseline distribution function is approximated by Bernstein polynomial. In this case-cohort design, the covariates can be considered as missing at random. This function employs the inverse probability weighting to construct likelihood function.
